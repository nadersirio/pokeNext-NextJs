# pokeNext-NextJs
Study and application of the React Framework, NextJs. The initial idea was to create an interactive page that fetched information from an API already created and structured. The chosen API was https://pokeapi.co

The page returns the pokemons from the Pokedex, and when selecting one, the user is guided to a 2nd dynamic page,
getting information from the chosen pokemon. A 3rd page is also provided, being responsible for bringing a greater and more accurate variety about a certain pokemon, such as weaknesses and strengths, and the shiny version of itself.
